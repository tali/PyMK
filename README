Python Tools for MikroKopter
----------------------------

At mikrokopter.de you can order very nice flying computers.
As I don't use Windows, I could not use the official tool to configure
them, so I wrote my own.  You are currently looking at my little pet
project, which is able to configure and monitor MikroKopters on
all platforms supporting Python.  It is not very polished and only offers
basic features, but it can already be used.

All this can be used freely (BSD license), see LICENSE for details.
You are welcome to contribute by suggesting new features, reporting bugs,
and submitting patches.


The functionality to communicate with your Mikrokopter is provided by MK.py.
There is a very simple monitor program named `km` which provides a
command line interface, see `km --help` for some supported commands.
