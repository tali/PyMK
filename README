Python Tools for MikroKopter
----------------------------

At mikrokopter.de you can order very nice flying computers.
As I don't use Windows, I could not use the official tool to configure
them, so I wrote my own.  You are currently looking at my little pet
project, which is able to configure and monitor MikroKopters on
all platforms supporting Python.  It is not very polished and only offers
basic features, but it can already be used.

All this is can be used freely (BSD license), see LICENSE for details.
You are welcome to contribute by suggesting new features, reporting bugs,
and submitting patches.
